## Congratulations on finishing the Baseline Monitoring Week!

If there are any surveys that you have not yet completed, now would be a great time to complete them.

Regardless if you enrolled in the trial or not, please keep using the application consistently to record active tasks, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and complete surveys that become available on a recurring basis.


### If you enrolled in the Physical Activity Trial:

You will now begin receiving daily push notifications for 2 weeks motivating you to engage in physical activity of different types.
We ask that you please read and open these notifications daily (we know you get many other notifications throughout your busy day).
