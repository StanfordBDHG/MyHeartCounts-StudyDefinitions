# Welcome to the My Heart Counts Study!
Weâ€™re thrilled to have you on board.
Your contributions are instrumental in advancing our understanding of cardiovascular health.
The insights we gain from this study will inform future research aimed at optimizing health.


## Time Commitment
We understand your time is valuable, so we aim to keep the daily time commitment to a minimum.


## Surveys
- **Frequency:** We encourage you to complete the surveys daily.
- **Flexibility:** If unable to complete a survey on a given day, it will remain active for later completion.
- **Batch Completion:** You may also complete all surveys at once ahead of time if preferred.


## Active Tasks and Activities
#### (Six-Minute Walk, 12-Minute Run, ECG)
- **Completion:** Please attempt each task at least once, if physically able.
- **Repetition:** Multiple data points are ideal, so try to complete each task you enjoy more than once.
- **Accessing Tasks:** If you can't find the active tasks, click the walking person icon in the upper left of the upcoming tasks tab to navigate to active tasks.


## Heart Health Dashboard
The Heart Health Dashboard combines various health aspects into one "health score".
While a score of 100 doesn't mean you are the healthiest person alive, and a score of 0 doesn't mean the opposite, higher scores generally indicate better health.
Use this tool to track your health trends over time.
