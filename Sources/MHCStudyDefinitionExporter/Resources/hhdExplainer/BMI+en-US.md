Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple calculation using height and weight (kg/m²) to estimate body fat. It’s widely used to assess health risks related to underweight, overweight, and obesity. However, BMI doesn’t account for muscle mass, bone density, age, sex, or ethnic differences, so it may misclassify some individuals—like athletes or older adults. As well, Asian individuals (e.g., South and East Asians) are recommended to have a BMI 2 units lower for each category due to greater fat deposition in and around organs in your body. While imperfect for individuals, BMI is a useful tool for tracking weight trends and health risks across large populations.
