Blood glucose is the amount of sugar in your blood, providing energy for your body’s cells.
Fasting blood glucose measures your blood sugar after not eating for at least 8 hours and helps detect diabetes or prediabetes.
HbA1c is a blood test that shows your average blood glucose over the past 2–3 months.
Both fasting glucose and HbA1c are important because high levels over time can damage blood vessels, nerves, and organs, raising your risk for heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, and vision loss, in addition to cancer and dementia!

Keeping blood glucose and HbA1c in healthy ranges helps protect your heart and overall health, making these numbers key indicators for long-term wellness.
Blood glucose targets aren’t perfect for everyone, as factors like age, health conditions, and medications matter.
Monitoring and managing blood sugar is especially important for people with diabetes, but healthy habits benefit everyone.

To improve your levels: eat more fiber-rich plants and nuts, maintain a healthy weight, exercise regularly, get enough sleep, and manage stress (exercise is one of the strongest tools we have to manage your serum cortisol levels).
These steps help keep blood sugar stable and protect your long-term health.
