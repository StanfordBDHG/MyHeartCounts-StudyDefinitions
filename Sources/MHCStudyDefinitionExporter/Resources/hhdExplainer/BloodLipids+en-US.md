LDL (low-density lipoprotein) is known as “bad” cholesterol because high levels can build up in artery walls, leading to atherosclerosis, heart attack, stroke, and dementia.
You are born with an LDL in the 30-50s and people who live outside of modern society have similar LDL levels.
While your body needs some cholesterol for cell function, too much LDL is harmful and leads to increased risk of cardiovascular disease and dementia.
Our scoring system helps you see your risk at a glance:

<55 mg/dL (100 points): Excellent—maximal protection, especially for high-risk patients
55–69 (90): Very good—ideal for heart disease patients
70–99 (80): Optimal for most adults
100–129 (60): Slightly above ideal; risk starts to rise
130–159 (40): High risk; consider lifestyle changes or medication
160–189 (20): Very high risk
≥190 (0): Severe risk; urgent action needed

Lowering LDL through diet, exercise, and, if needed, medication helps reduce cardiovascular risk.
LDL targets may differ based on individual risk factors, so discuss your goals with a healthcare provider. Regular testing is important, as high LDL often has no symptoms.
Aim for lower LDL to protect your heart!"
