Blood pressure measures the force of blood against artery walls and is recorded as two numbers: systolic (top number) and diastolic (bottom number).
Systolic pressure indicates artery pressure when the heart beats, while diastolic pressure measures artery pressure between beats.

High blood pressure (hypertension) often has no symptoms but raises the risk of heart attack, stroke, and kidney disease if left untreated. As well, high blood pressure is associated with risk of dementia.
Regular monitoring is important. Lifestyle changes like not smoking, staying active, eating well, and managing stress help keep blood pressure in a healthy range.
While blood pressure targets may vary for some individuals, controlling it is vital for reducing serious health risks.

Normal blood pressure is below 120/80 mmHg.
Elevated blood pressure is considered 120-129/<80 mmHg
Hypertension stage 1 is 130-139/80-89 mmHg
Hypertension stage 2 is ≥140/≥90 mmHg"
