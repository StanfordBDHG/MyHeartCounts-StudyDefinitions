This dietary questionnaire, developed by the British Heart Foundation, helps you assess your eating habits and identify areas for improvement. A healthy diet—rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats—supports heart health, energy, and chronic disease prevention (such as cancer and dementia). Limiting added sugars, salt, and processed foods is also important. However, diet is complex and influenced by culture, preferences, and access to foods, making it hard to assess accurately with simple surveys. While general guidelines help, personalized nutrition advice with your healthcare provider or licensed dietician is best for lasting health benefits.

If your score indicates room for improvement, consider gradually adopting healthier dietary habits to enhance your overall well-being and reduce your long-term risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and dementia.
