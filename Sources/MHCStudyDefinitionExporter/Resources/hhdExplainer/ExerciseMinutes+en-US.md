Regular physical activity is essential for overall health, reducing the risk of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, dementia, and early death.
Moderate exercise, like brisk walking or jogging, increases your heart rate but still lets you talk in brief sentences, while vigorous exercise, like running or high-intensity interval training, makes talking difficult due to heavier breathing.
Both types benefit your body and mind, but vigorous activity offers greater fitness improvements.
Aim to move more throughout the day—take the stairs, stretch regularly, or try new activities you enjoy.
Even small increases in activity can lead to significant health benefits, especially for those who are currently inactive!
