While often overlooked, your overall mental health and wellbeing is strongly associated with risk of chronic disease. The World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) is a brief, validated questionnaire designed to measure an individual's mental well-being over the past two weeks. It consists of five statements assessing mood, relaxation, energy levels, restfulness, and engagement in daily activities. Respondents rate each statement on a scale from 0 ("at no time") to 5 ("all of the time"), with higher scores indicating better mental well-being. Scores range from 0 to 25, and multiplying by four converts this to a percentage (0-100). Scores below 50% suggest poor mental well-being and may indicate the need for further evaluation for mental health conditions such as depression.
