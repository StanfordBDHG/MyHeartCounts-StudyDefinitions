Smoking and vaping significantly increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks, strokes, and peripheral artery disease. These habits damage blood vessels, elevate blood pressure, and accelerate plaque buildup in arteries. Additionally, smoking and vaping negatively impact lung function, increase cancer risk, and reduce overall life expectancy. Quitting smoking or vaping is among the most effective ways to improve cardiovascular and overall health. If you are thinking of stopping smoking and/or vaping, please talk with your healthcare provider about medications and over-the-counter products that can help you in your journey.
