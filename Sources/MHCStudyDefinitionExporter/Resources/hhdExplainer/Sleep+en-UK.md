Sleep is essential for your body and mind, supporting memory, mood, heart health, metabolism, and immune function. Most adults need 7–9 hours of quality sleep each night for optimal health. Too little sleep increases your risk for obesity, diabetes, heart disease, depression, and accidents, while impairing memory and decision-making. However, regularly sleeping much longer than 9 hours can also be linked to health problems, sometimes signaling underlying conditions (such as depression or a serious underlying health condition). Both short and long sleep durations are associated with higher risks of chronic disease and early death. Aim for consistent, restorative sleep in the 7–9 hour range to help your body repair, your mind function at its best, and your heart stay healthy.
